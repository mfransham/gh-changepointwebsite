		<p> Attachment theory is essential for understanding how human beings function in relationships and how people develop social and psychological difficulties. It is also fundamental for understanding what constitutes psychological well-being. While attachment theory is a fascinating field of study, busy front line practitioners and supervisors are best served with training that helps them to translate the theory into principles, tools and practical strategies for working. This course does just that. It is designed to increase the confidence of practitioners and supervisors to act as change agents with their clients and supervisees, and to understand and relate to people in an attuned way.</p>
		
		<p>This training course introduces contemporary attachment theory, its links with child development, neurobiology and the emerging field of narrative medicine, which harnesses the powerful effects of personal stories on human development. The course uses powerful case studies to illustrate how and why people develop different attachment strategies.</p>
		
		<p>The course is primarily designed for practitioners who work with adults. People who work with children and adolescents have also found the course relevant because it covers the development of attachment strategies and psychological self-protective strategies from birth across the lifespan, and also because professionals who work with children also work in the context of family systems and often with the adults who care for the child. </p><br />
	
		<p><h3><img class="pull-left" src="../img/arrows-blue.png" width="20px"></img>&nbsp Course structure</p></h3>
