			<h4 class="media-heading">Changing Offending Behaviour</h4>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">Clark Baim & Lydia Guthrie, 2014</p>
			<p>A one-stop resource of practical exercises for professionals to use in direct work with offenders aged 16+.  Covering must-know theory and packed with practical exercises that work, this is an indispensable resource for probation workers and related professionals.</p>
			<p>"Like all great books, this one will help you by encouraging you to ask intelligent and provocative questions - and if you use it wisely, it will support positive changes in your practice and therefore positive changes in others."

			<h4 class="media-heading">Mindful Co-Working</h4>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">Clark Baim, 2013</p>
			<p>Are you making the most of your co-working relationships?  Most of us work with others and spend as much time with colleagues as we do with our families - so it's important our working relationships run smoothly. By helping workers become more attuned to their colleagues, mindful co-working removes the pressure and stress of competition from working relationships to make them both more enjoyable and more effective.</p>
			<p>This indispensable guide to co-working is required reading for anyone who wants to work confidently with colleagues - and enjoy it!</p>

			<h4 class="media-heading">Attachment-Based Practice With Adults</h4>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">Clark Baim & Tony Morrison, 2011</p>
			<p>This illustrated, multi-media resource offers a theoretically coherent, practice-based model for the application of attachment theory in working with any adults, including those who pose a risk to themselves or to other adults or children.</p>
			<p>This essential guide increases the confidence of practitioners to act as change agents with their clients, and to relate to them in attuned and effective ways. It can be used by individuals, teams, co-workers, supervisors and teachers/trainers to reflect on and improve the preparation, use and support of attachment thinking in practice. It speaks to diverse professions and modalities and can be used in a multidisciplinary environment by both adult and children's services.</p>
